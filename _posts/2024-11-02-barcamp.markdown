# Introduction

This week I spoke at [BarCamp Cantebury](https://barcampcanterbury.com/), a yearly tech conference taking place in Canterbury, where I go to University.

# Event Overview
BarCamp Canterbury has been running since 2008, providing a conference for tech enthusiasts to connect. This year, the event continued its tradition of being free-to-attend, thanks to support from sponsors. They describe it as an 'unconference' as all the talks are given on the day by attendees, with no prior scheduling.

Talks began at 10:00am, each 30 minutes, hosted by attendees, who could talk about whatever they want.

The schedule is here below:

# My Talk

I gave the talk 'A Brief Introduction To Stack-Oriented Programming Languages', a recording of which can be seen below. It was a short talk explaining what 
stack-oriented languages are, why they might be useful and their history, concluding with stuff people could try at home.

A recording is here below, it's compressed for the browser, feel free to email me at [fdphoughton@protonmail.com](mailto:fdphoughton@protonmail.com) for the higher quality recording.

The very beginning and the ending Q&A are sadly missing from the recording.

# Highlights of the Day
- **Talks and Sessions**: Attendees presented on a wide array of topics, from software development to DIY electronics, with this year’s theme being *Kent Engineers*. One of the most engaging sessions I attended was on 'Overengineering A Lightswitch', all about configuring a smart house lighting system.
  
- **Swap Shop**: This was a fantastic initiative where people brought in gadgets, cables, tools, and tech components they no longer needed. It was inspiring to see one person’s "junk" become someone else’s next project, and I grabbed a small e-Paper board for future use:

- **Food and Community**: Thanks to [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/), there was free pizza for everyone, catering to both vegan and gluten-free preferences. This added a great community feel, allowing everyone to connect over lunch and continue conversations sparked during sessions.
